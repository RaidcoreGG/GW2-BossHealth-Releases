# GW2-BossHealth-Releases
Public repository for releases of the boss health addon.

## Installation
Install via the [Nexus](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus) Addon Library or download the latest `bosshealth.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/GW2-BossHealth-Releases/releases) and place in `<Guild Wars 2>/addons`.

## How it works
This addon reads out the currently targeted character and renders an overlay with additional information about it.

## Limitations
- **Instanced PvE only**
- Enemies only
- NPCs only (e.g. players that become hostile due to a game mechanic such as during slothasor, will not have the overlay)

## Features
- Target health & barrier up to one decimal of the current notation (e.g. 17.1K, 15.6M)
- Breakbar percentage
- Tooltip on hover with the exact health & barrier
