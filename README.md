# DISCLAIMER
# Modifying Guild Wars 2 through any third party software is not supported by ArenaNet nor by any of its partners.
# You are using this addon at your own risk.

# GW2-BossHealth-Releases
Public repository for releases of the boss health addon.
The actual source code is kept private in compliance with directives by ArenaNet for implementations based on reverse engineering.

## Installation
Install via the [Nexus](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus) Addon Library or download the latest `bosshealth.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/GW2-BossHealth-Releases/releases) and place in `<Guild Wars 2>/addons`.

## How it works
This addon reads out the currently targeted character and renders an overlay with additional information about it.

## Limitations
- **Instanced PvE only**
- Enemies only
- NPCs only (e.g. players that become hostile due to a game mechanic such as during slothasor, will not have the overlay)

## Features
- Target health & barrier up to one decimal of the current notation (e.g. 17.1K, 15.6M)
- Breakbar percentage
- Tooltip on hover with the exact health & barrier

## Is it safe to use?
# You are using this addon at your own risk.
Historically ArenaNet had requested to not show the health of targets, because it would reveal that dead players upscale open world bosses and possibly cause friction.
Furthermore it breaks immersion to see the boss health upscale in real time.
Since this addon is limited to instanced PvE only, both of these concerns do not apply.

Refer to the official [Third Party Program Policy](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013625034-Policy-Third-Party-Programs) and decide for yourself whether this addon goes too far.  
**If you believe this addon should be removed, we'd be happy to hear your reasons as the perception of the community arguably matters most.**  
We are constantly re-evaluating any implementation as the consensus of the community shifts and new statements or requests are made by ArenaNet officials.  
As a matter of fact, you can achieve similar load times by buying very good hardware, therefore giving lower-end machines the ability to be "on par" does not constitute an advantage in our eyes.

# To ArenaNet
## Please direct any concerns or takedown requests to [contact@raidcore.gg](mailto:contact@raidcore.gg). Any ArenaNet employee who wants to review the implementation may also contact us at the aforementioned email address to gain access.
